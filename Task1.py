#Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
#Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
#1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
#2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
#o	Addition
#o	Subtraction
#o	Multiplication
#o	Division
#3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.#

a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))

addition = a+b
subtraction = a-b
multiplication = a*b
division = a/b

print("Addition: ",addition)
print("Subtraction: ",subtraction)
print("Multiplication: ",multiplication)
print("Divison: ",division)
